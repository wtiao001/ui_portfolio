                       <h3>As pioneer of the smart speaker, Amazon has been met with rival products from other technology giants. We looked at the top competitors in the smart speaker market (Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod), researching respective sale statistics and the average smart speaker owner.</h3>

The introduction of new competition and increase in total market size means that Amazon needs to react in order to remain a viable competitor.</h3>
